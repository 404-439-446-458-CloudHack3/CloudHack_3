Problem Statement 3 - Breaking down monoliths

This problem statement has two objectives:

1. Get familiar with reading error stack trace and debugging code.
2. Convert a monolith architecture based docker-compose application into a microservices based architecture.

## Tasks
0. ### Task-0 - Completing the code üë®‚Äçüíªüë©‚Äçüíª
    #### 0.0. Add modules to ```landing/app/requirements.txt```
      - The following modules are required by the ```landing-service```:
      - ```flask```
      - ```flask-restful```
      - ```requests```
    #### 0.1. Write the ```landing/Dockerfile```
      - Dockerfiles help building images using a given set of instructions. You can learn about the basics of Dockerfiles [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/). Use this document to understand the meaning of certain keywords used by Dockerfiles.
      - For this project, you need to write a Dockerfile for a python application. I have provided sample Dockerfiles [here](https://docs.docker.com/language/python/build-images/) and [here](https://hasura.io/blog/how-to-write-dockerfiles-for-python-web-apps-6d173842ae1d/). 
      - Specifications for the ```Dockerfile```:
          - Use the image ```python:3.8-alpine```
          - Copy the contents of ```./app/requirements.txt``` to ```/app/requirements.txt```
          - Set the working directory to ```/app```
          - Run the following command: 
            ```
            apk add --update \
            && pip install --upgrade pip  \
            && pip install -r requirements.txt \
            && rm -rf /var/cache/apk/*
            ```
          - Copy the contents of the ```./app``` to ```/app``` folder
          - Run the command ```python app.py```

1. ### Task-1 - Debugging üêõüî®
    #### 1.0. Fix the variable type of the incoming values from index.html
      - By default, Python considers all input as string. Due to this, the arithmetic operations do not seem to be working as intended. 
      - Fix the type of the two variable values received from ```index.html```
    #### 1.1. Handle the None type exception 
      - This bug is observed only after fixing the previous bug.
      - By default, no values are provided by ```index.html```, causing the application to throw exceptions and crash when localhost:5050 is loaded initially.
      - Avoid the crash by handling the exceptions raised in the landing-service app.

2. ### Task-2 - Breaking the monolith architecture ü™®‚õèÔ∏è
    #### 2.0. Decouple the arithmetic functions from landing-service.
      - The four arithmetic functions currently reside under landing-service. However, if landing-service were to become unavailable for whatever reason, the four functions would be unavailable as well.
      - Create separate flask applications, Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division. Each application will consist of a class which inherits the ```Resource``` class of ```flask_restful``` module. 
      - Define a GET method within the class with necessary parameters. An example of this class with the method defined can be found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25098661/flask-restful-add-resource-parameters) and [here](https://lovelace.oulu.fi/ohjelmoitava-web/programmable-web-project-spring-2019/implementing-rest-apis-with-flask/)
      - Use the ```add_resource``` function to add the class as a resource and define the API endpoint. Make sure to also mention the type of the parameters in the endpoint. 
       Example: ```api.add_resource(<class-name>, '/<int:argument0>/<int:argument1>')```
      - Update the ```Docker-compose.yaml``` to recognize the newly added flask applications as separate services. **The ```Docker-compose.yaml``` lets you define the port number and network alias that will be used by ```landing-service``` to communicate within the entire architecture**
       - Test the new microservices-based application. 
    #### 2.1. Add three more services
      - Proceed to add three more services that perform a certain function. You will also have to make changes to the frontend defined in ```index.html``` to make these functions available. Mentioned below are possible functions you could implement but feel free to add your own.
      - ```gcd```: Takes two numbers as arguments and returns their [Greatest Common Divisor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor)
      - ```lcm```: Takes two numbers as arguments and returns their [Least Common Multiple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_common_multiple)
      - ```modulus```: Returns the remainder of two numbers after division. [Reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remainder)
      - ```exponent```: Returns the result of the arithmetic operation a<sup>b</sup>
      - ```greater_than```: Return ```True``` if the first value is greater than the second else ```False``
      - ```less_than```: return ```True``` if the first value is less than the second else ```False```
      - ```equal```: return ```True``` if the first value is equal to the second else ```False```
